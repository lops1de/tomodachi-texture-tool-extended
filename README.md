## Download

Head to the [Releases](../../releases/latest) page and download the binary for your platform:

> **Windows Antivirus Warning:** Some antivirus tools (including Windows Defender) may flag the `.exe` as suspicious. This is a **false positive** caused by PyInstaller — the bundler used to package the app. The source code is fully open and auditable above. You can also build it yourself (see [Building from Source](#building-from-source)).

| Platform | File |
|----------|------|
| Windows  | `TomodachiTextureTool-Windows.exe` |
| macOS    | `TomodachiTextureTool-macOS` |
| Linux    | `TomodachiTextureTool-Linux` |

> **macOS / Linux:** you may need to mark the file as executable first:
> ```sh
> chmod +x TomodachiTextureTool-*
> ```

> **macOS Gatekeeper:** right-click → Open the first time if you get a security warning.

## How to Use
1. **Backup** your savefolder
2. **Open the tool** and select your PNG image.
3. Set the **Item Type** and **Item ID** matching the file you want to replace.
4. Set the **Ugc Folder** to the `Ugc` directory.
5. Click **Convert & Export** — the tool writes both `.canvas.zs` and `.ugctex.zs` directly to your Ugc folder.
6. (re)launch the game.
